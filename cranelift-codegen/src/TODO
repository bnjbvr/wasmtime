TODO:

- Finish the lowering logic (machinst/lower.rs) using the new lookup table
  functionality (machinst/pattern.rs).

- Build some simple lookup tables for tree-matching. Maybe some helper macros
  for this.

- Wire up an alternative backend flow: right after legalization, feed into
  MachInst lowering and dump MachInsts. Test with various CLIR inputs.

- Hook up regalloc to lowered blocks; replace regs with real regs (and insert
  moves/spills/fills where necessary)

  - trait-based interface over sequence of instructions with reg slots
  - trait-based interface to allow regalloc to insert spills/fills/moves
  - perhaps go back to CLIR-based rep, but replace Encoding with MachInst (or
    array of MachInst) for a given insn.

- Encoding backend
