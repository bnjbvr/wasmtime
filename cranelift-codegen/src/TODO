TODO:

- Write some simple isel tree-matching rules for ARM64, for testing. Write some
  tests of the lowering using this.

- Wire up MachInst to regalloc. Figure out how to generalize over MachRegs and
  existing Value infra. Figure out how to generalize over move/spill/fill
  insertion.

- Encoding backend
